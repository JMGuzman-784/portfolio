# 💻 Jose Guzman's Portfolio

Welcome to the **modernized, Apple-inspired** version of my portfolio — where clean design meets creative development.

---

## ✨ Overview
A refined display of projects and experiments crafted during and after my Coding Bootcamp journey. The site focuses on simplicity, fluid motion, and a strong personal brand identity — blending minimalist design with clear navigation.

---

## 🧠 Technologies
- **HTML5** – structured for accessibility and modern standards  
- **CSS3** – inspired by Apple’s design: minimal gradients, depth, and focus on white space  
- **JavaScript (light use)** – for smooth transitions and interactivity  
- **Bootstrap (partial)** – responsive grid and layout support
