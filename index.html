            <h2 class="">&#60; HELLO THERE! &#62;</h2>
            <p class="">It seems that you have stumbled upon my Portfolio. Well allow me to introduce
                myself. I love to code. I have always loved to work with computers and the software 
                part of technology. If you take a look at the upper-right hand corner you will notice 
                4 tabs pertaining to what content you with find on this website. This website is mainly 
                to show you what I am capable of doing with my fingers, some coffe, a keyboard, and code. 
                Please feel free to navigate through my website and click the other webpages that I have 
                created. Also you can always provide feedback by contacting me through the contact tab. 
                Thank you so much for taking a look at what I can do. Take care, brush ya hair!</p>
