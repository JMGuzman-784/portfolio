            <h2 class="">&#60; HELLO THERE! &#62;</h2>
            <p class="">It seems that you have stumbled upon my portfolio. 
                Allow me to introduce myself. I love to code. I have always 
                loved to work with computers and the software part of 
                technology. If you look at the upper-right corner of the 
                screen, you will notice four tabs about what content you 
                find on this website. This website shows you the work I can 
                achieve using my fingers, coffee, and a keyboard. Please, 
                feel free to navigate through my website and click the other 
                web pages that I have created. Also, you can always provide 
                feedback by contacting me through the contact tab. Thank you 
                so much for taking a look at what I can do. Take care, brush 
                ya hair!</p>

                    <p>This Webpage was created during class and was also a Homework assignment which I was very

                    <h2 class="">Eminem Fanpage</h2>
                    <p>This webpage was more of a fanpage for my favorite rapper, Eminem. This was created during 
                        the Prework of my bootcamp where I was beginning to learn about css.</p>

                    <p>This Webpage was also created during the Prework of my bootcamp experience in which I learned 
                        alot about Javascript and how certain functions worked.</p>
